# Some of the entries in .gitconfig need to be calculated here.  That
# means we can't store .gitconfig itself in the repository; otherwise
# we'd get spurious complaints from git-status all the time.  So,
# instead, we put all of the static options in ~/.gitconfig.in, and
# store this in the repository.  This script copies this file to
# ~/.gitconfig on every login, and then adds all of the calculated
# values.  ~/.gitconfig is ignored by git, so it's never checked in
# and never mentioned by git-status.

cp ~/.gitconfig.in ~/.gitconfig


# core.excludesfile needs to get set here because it depends on $HOME,
# which can be different on different machines.  And it seems that the
# config file cannot contain parameter references.

git config --global core.excludesfile "$HOME/.gitignore.global"
